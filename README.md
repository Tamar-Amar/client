## 📊 Google Sheets & Excel Integration

- Monthly Excel-style reports per group and year

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 18** + **TypeScript**
- **React Query** – for state, cache, and refetching
- **Zod** – for frontend validation
- **MUI** – for styled components
- **Axios** – for backend communication
- **PDFKit** – for PDF generation
- **ExcelJS** – for programmatic Excel (.xlsx) file generation and export
- **Google Sheets API v4** – for writing Excel-style data to sheets
- **NodeMailer** – for email delivery

## 💡 Design Logic

- **Smart Calendar Engine**  
  Based on a dynamic Jewish `holidays.ts` file.  
  Entire weeks (Sunday–Thursday) are skipped if all days are holidays.

- **Weekly Aggregation**  
  Activities are grouped and exported per calendar week (Sunday–Saturday).

- **Soft Deletion Logic**  
  Only active entities (`isActive: true`) are displayed in the UI.

- **Manual Export Trigger**  
  Admin triggers the report export manually.  
  Status indicator shows the last successful update.

---

## 📥 Report Flow

1. Admin clicks "Export Reports"
2. Frontend calls `POST /export-to-sheets`
3. Backend:
   - Groups activities by week
   - Writes to Google Sheets (monthly + yearly)
   - Generates PDF buffers
   - Sends emails to each operator
